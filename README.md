# Fitness-Dashboard
Dashboard Application (App name currently unknown)/Team 13

#### Q1: What are you planning to build?

We are planning on building a web application that provides the user with utilities to help monitor and improve their fitness. 
Right now in the fitness world, there is a lack of centralization for fitness utilities with calorie-tracking being dominated 
by MyFitnessPal, workout logging being distributed across a a few mobile applications (such as Jefit). 
The goal of our application is to unite these into one platform in order to make it easier for the user to keep track of their fitness. 

Our application will provide a fitness dashboard with the following functionality:
    
    - Fitness News Aggregator/In-House Blog
    - Fitness logging, supplemented by an extensive exercise catalogue
    - Analysis of fitness, projected weight-loss, projected strength gain, etc.
    - Calorie/Nutrient tracking, supplemented by a crowd-sourced recipe/nutrition info database
    - Custom calendar for fitness related goals
    - Social Media integration
    - Interface to talk to in-house fitness experts ??

#### Q2: Who are your target users?

Our product could find itself in the hands of professional athletes, personal trainers, fitness enthusiasts and anyone who would like a more rigorous approach to fitness and/or health with more customization options to make the program centered around your own routine.

Despite this, this does not mean our application is not a tool to the casual fitness enthusiast, and could be used minimally to provide the same functionality that MyFitnessPal and others would.


#### Q3: Why would your users choose your product? What are they using today to solve their problem?

In the current state of the market, our user base finds itself without a centralized repository for all of this.

MyFitnessPal, the biggest name in the market, focuses mostly on nutrient tracking, and has a severely lacking fitness planner 
that lacks customized goals, such as squatting X amount or running X miles in Y minutes. Instead their interface focus on the 
nutrition portion of exercise and lets you put in the amount of calories burned.

Our application is built on the idea that not everybody interested in their fitness is interested only in their calorie input/output. 
It is built on the premise that people want tools to track their physical benchmarks in addition which is supplemented by their food 
intake as the two naturally go hand in hand. 

We mentioned athletes as an example target user that might want to use our application. Say athlete Ashley wants to see their optimal
100m time. Our application would provide the infrastructure to gather data not only on WHAT the time is, but WHY he might have 
achieved that time, by supplementing the time data with other variables such as nutrition/hydration/sleep time, and so on.

Ultimately, our application does not generalize health goals, and if you're goal is to become unhealthy, then our application 
should theoretically enable you to do that. This differentiates from major fitness web sites who seem to generalize peoples 
fitness goals, and are not as goal-oriented.
