#### Events

We are going to have online meetings two times a week in order to discuss the current state of the project. We will have a general meeting focusing on the overall features and pages that need to be implemented. Another meeting will deal with our current progress of what was assigned to us. This will allow us to get a better understanding of where we are currently at in the project. More specifically, we will be meeting every tuesday night at 8:00 P.M. online using whatsapp/slack. This will be our general meeting. At 8:00 P.M. on friday we will be meeting online using whatsapp/slack to deal with the current status of what we are working on. Additional meetings may occur throughout the week between team members who need help completing their assigned part for the week.

#### Artifacts
 
During our iterations we have been using Trello to keep track of everything that we need to complete. Currently we have all the features and pages in our 'in process' tab. Eventually, when the feature is complete, we will begin moving them into the 'to examine' tab. From there there will be heavy quality assurance on each feature/page and any extra notes about the page will be added to the 'notes' tab. At the beginning of our iteration our trello board currently looks like this:

We also have a google document todo list so that we can easily track when a feature is supposed to be done by. This allows us to create a burndown chart for each person, making sure that they got their work done on time. It is very similar to the trello board except it has due dates.
