# FITNESS DASHBOARD(Unnamed)/TEAM 13

## Iteration 01 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: October 15th 2016
 * Where: ONLINE

## Process - Reflection

Short introduction:
An online meeting was held in order to decide on what kind of product to build and what everyone on the team was comfortable with building.

Decisions turned out well:

 * We narrowed down our ideas to about 8 ideas and asked all team members to vote their most preferred.
 * We were able to partially decide on the framework for our application.
 * We were able to finalize on the roles of each team member.

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Having just an online slack meeting didn't turn out as well as we were never able to get everyone online at the same time.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * Meet at least twice a week. One online and another in-person at the end of the week. This is necessary to keep everyone updated and make sure we are doing well with time. 

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * Produced an idea for an application.
 * Split future work between team members.

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * We planned to finalize the framework for our application but it has not been completely decided on.
 * We planned to have some starter/base code down but weren't able to get to it yet.
 * We planned to set up Trello and burn down charts.

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 
 * Build the initial wireframe for our the application.
 * Set up Trello.
 * Set up burn down charts.
 * Commence work on the project.
