#### Events

We are going to have online meetings two times a week in order to discuss the current state of the project. We will have a general meeting focusing on the overall features and pages that need to be implemented. Another meeting will deal with our current progress of what was assigned to us. This will allow us to get a better understanding of where we are currently at in the project. More specifically, we will be meeting every tuesday night at 8:00 P.M. online using whatsapp/slack. This will be our general meeting. At 8:00 P.M. on friday we will be meeting online using whatsapp/slack to deal with the current status of what we are working on. Additional meetings may occur throughout the week between team members who need help completing their assigned part for the week.

#### Artifacts

First and foremost, we will be developing a a burndown chart for our features and pages. This chart will give us an accurate depiction of when things should be done. Additionally, we will be using other tools to keep track of features, pages, bugs etc. For this we will use Trello. Trello will allow us to categorize and assign different bugs as well as keep track of what each other is working on. Features and pages are going to have the highest priority. Bugs will also have a high priority, depending on the severity. Things such as spelling errors will be have low priority and can be done near the end of the project. Initially, each team member is going to choose a specific piece of the project to work on. This could be something like the front end for the main page, or the backend for a sub-page. When the team member has completed their part they will then pick an open page of feature request and commence work on that.

## Product

In this iteration we have 4 main goals:

#### Goals and tasks:

1. Produce an idea for an application
2. Split future work evenly between the team members
3. Setup burndown charts
4. Get the initial product wireframed

By completeing these four goals we will have succesfully completed the building blocks of our application. We will know when specific parts should be completed, how work is going to be divided, and a basic idea of what our product is going to look like. This will allow us to move forward with a product in mind and allow us to work on the code.

#### Artifacts

During this iteration we hope to create accurate burn down charts, setup Trello for our team, and build the initial wireframe of what we think it should look like. More specifically, the burn down chart is going to allow us to see when everything should be done, the Trello board will help us track pages, features, and bugs and the initial wireframe will give us a strong base, allowing us to commence work on the project. In the next iteration we would like to get the website hosted to allow feedback from potential users. That way we can adjust our user interface accordingly.
