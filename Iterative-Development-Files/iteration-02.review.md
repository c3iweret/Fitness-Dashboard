# FITNESS DASHBOARD/TEAM 13

## Iteration 02 - Review & Retrospect

 * Start date: Nov 14th 2016
 * Where: ONLINE - Using Slack

## Process - Reflection

Short introduction: Throughout this iteration we have been trying to gradually move towards the alpha version of the fitness application. Although we had some struggles with overlapping work, I firmly believe that by the end of the next iteration we will have a fully working beta version of our platform.


Decisions turned out well:

 * Letting each team member pick the specific page/feature they would like to work on
 * Seperating the features into their own pages so our work does not constantly overlap

Decisions did not turn out as well as you hoped:

 * Letting people have the freedom to work on the project whenever they would like
 * Giving people the freedom meant there was a lack of communication from everybody throughout the iteration
 * Some functionalities were not able to be delivered on time in this iteration due to missing fundations due to above reasons.

We are planning to make the following changes to our process:

 * We need to set firm due dates for when a feature should be created. You MUST finish before that date. Some people left their work until the last minute before the video demo and was not quite finished
 * Meet at least twice a week. One online and another in-person at the end of the week. This is necessary to keep everyone updated and make sure we are doing well with time
 * Keep in constant communication and notify team members when something is going wrong
 * Each team member should take his/her own responsibility to check group chats constantly

## Product - Review

Goals/tasks that were met/completed:

 * Fitness News Aggregator
 * Social Media Integration (Login)
 * Recipe Catalogue that pulls from a database
 * Exercise plan creator

Goals/tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

 * Custom Calendar for fitness related goals
 * More Social Media Integration Functionalities such as sharing fitness stats.
 * Find recipes with specific macros

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:
 
 * We need to set firm deadlines for out features and make sure we follow them
 * Not give team members as much freedom and ensuring that we follow the scrum methodology
 * Meet up frequently with the team and each meeting duration will be limited to 15 minutes, discussing how we can move this into the beta phase
 * Have goals planned in each 15 minutes meeting to resolve current issues in our product
